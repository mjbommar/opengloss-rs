## Highlights
- **Unified type-ahead widget**: replaced browser datalists with a custom dropdown that works on the home page and every shared header, shows up to twelve trie-backed matches, and supports keyboard navigation plus instant navigation to `/lexeme`.
- **Friendlier discovery tools**: the landing page now links to the `farm` example entry, offers a “Random word” surprise button, and trims the CTA stack to keep things focused.
- **Streamlined lexeme overview**: the top-of-page cards were redesigned into low-profile stats with inline part-of-speech chips and a compact encyclopedia jump link so key facts stay above the fold.
- Documentation now reflects the richer UI/UX and clarifies how to interact with the CLI and HTTP API.

## Packaging
- `scripts/package_release.sh v0.4.0`
- Upload `dist/opengloss-rs-v0.4.0-<target>.tar.zst` and its `.sha256` to the GitHub release.
