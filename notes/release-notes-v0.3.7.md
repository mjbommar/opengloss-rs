## Highlights
- **Single source of truth for definitions**: the lexeme template now skips the redundant “Definitions” block and goes straight into per-sense cards, so visitors no longer read the same glossary twice.
- **Readable examples**: each sense’s example sentences render as bulleted lists, making long sets of usage notes easier to scan.

## Packaging
- `scripts/package_release.sh v0.3.7`
- Upload `dist/opengloss-rs-v0.3.7-<target>.tar.zst` and its `.sha256` to the GitHub release.
